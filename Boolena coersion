// All values except false, 0, 0n, -0, “”, null, undefined, and NaN are truthy values.



// OR ( | | ) operator - If the first value is truthy, then the first value is returned. Otherwise,
// always the second value gets returned.

// AND ( && ) operator - If both the values are truthy, always the second value is returned. If the first value is
// falsy then the first value is returned or if the second value is falsy then the second value is returned.


var x = 10;
var y = "badal";
var z = undefined;
var a = 0;

console.log(x||y); //10; here if first is truthy then it will return first otherwise second in all case.
console.log(z||a);//0
console.log(x||z);//10
console.log(x&&y);//badal becoz x & y are truthy so will return second value.
console.log(x&&z);//undefined
console.log(a&&y);//0
